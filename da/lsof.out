Open files
Processes with open files are the usual culprits. Display them:

lsof +f -- <mountpoint or device>

fuser can also be used, but to my mind lsof has a more useful output. However fuser is useful when it comes to killing the processes causing your dramas so you can get on with your life.

List files on <mountpoint> (see caveat above):

fuser -vmM <mountpoint>
Interactively kill only processes with files open for writing:

fuser -vmMkiw <mountpoint>
After remounting read-only (mount -o remount,ro <mountpoint>), it is safe(r) to kill all remaining processes:

fuser -vmMk <mountpoint>
